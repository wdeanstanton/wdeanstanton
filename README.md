- 👋 Hi, I’m @wdeanstanton
- 👀 I’m expert in Linux (most recently, Alma and CentOS) and bash
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Ubuntu on Windows 10, and to a lesser extent C++ and Java
- 💞️ My hobby is interesting to programmers, engineers, and others with good attention to detail:
     Gimmick Car Rallyes, which are public [complex driving logic puzzle events](https://sites.google.com/site/therallyeclub/rallye-intro),
     something like a puzzle hunt or scavenger hunt and a little like "Simon Says” (but nothing like a race). The creator is trying to fool you, but you don't know how and when.
     
     During the pandemic, [The Rallye Club of Silicon Valley](TheRallyeClub.org/calendar) has offered
     open online rallyes, using Google Maps Street View, rather than physical driving events.
     
     I also like other games: [Boggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/130705/super-big-boggle), [Set](https://www.playmonster.com/product/set/), [Bang!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%21_%28card_game%29)
     and puzzles: [KenKen](http://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/game), Crosswords (especially [oddball ones](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-PUZZLEB-2321)).
